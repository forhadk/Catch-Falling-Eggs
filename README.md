# Catch Falling Eggs 

This is a simple graphical game. The objective of the game is to catch falling eggs in the basket. I used `C++` as a programming language and `GLUT` (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) to write the structure of the game. 


## Rules Of The Game:
- If the player catches `10` eggs, then `Level Up`  
- For each new level, speed of falling eggs is `Increased` 
- If the player misses `10` eggs, then `Game Over`  



## Instructions:
- The objective of the game is to catch falling eggs in the `basket`.  
- To `move` basket use `mouse`. 
- To start, press key `S`/`s` or click right mouse button then click `Start Game`.  
- To change the falling eggs direction to the left, press `A`/`a` key.  
- To change the falling eggs direction to the right, press `D`/`d` key.  
- To Quit manually, press key `Q`/`q` or click right mouse button then click `Quit`.
