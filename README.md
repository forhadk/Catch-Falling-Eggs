# Catch Falling Eggs 

This is a simple graphical game. The objective of the game is to catch falling eggs in the basket. I used `C++` as a programming language and `GLUT` (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) to write the structure of the game. 

## Rules of the game:
- If the player catches `10` eggs, then `Level Up`  
- For each new level, speed of falling eggs is `Increased` 
- If the player misses `10` eggs, then `Game Over`  


## Procedures to run this game on your machine 
In order to this game, you need to follow these steps - 
- Make sure your machine have `Codeblocks IDE` and `GLUT` installed.  
- Open a new `GLUT` project. 
- Replace `main.cpp` file of your new project folder by the `main.cpp` file of this repository. 
- Now `build` and `run` the code. 
- Enjoy the game.
