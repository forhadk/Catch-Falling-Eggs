# Catch Falling Eggs 

This is a simple graphical game based on the concept of "Catch Falling Eggs". I used `C++` as a programming language and `GLUT` (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) to write the struture of the game. 

## Rules of the game:
- If the player catches `10` eggs, then `Lavel Up`  
- For each new level, speed of falling eggs is `Increased` 
- If the player misses `10` eggs, then `Game Over`
