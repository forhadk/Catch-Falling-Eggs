# Catch Falling Eggs 

This is a simple graphical game. The objective of the game is to catch falling eggs in the basket. I used `C++` as a programming language and `GLUT` (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) to write the structure of the game. 

## Rules Of The Game:
- If the player catches `10` eggs, then `Level Up`  
- For each new level, speed of falling eggs is `Increased` 
- If the player misses `10` eggs, then `Game Over`  


## Instructions:
- The objective of the game is to catch falling eggs in the `basket`.  
- To `move` basket use `mouse`. 
- To start, press key `S`/`s` or click right mouse button then click `Start Game`.  
- To change the falling eggs direction to the left, press `A`/`a` key.  
- To change the falling eggs direction to the right, press `D`/`d` key.  
- To Quit manually, press key `Q`/`q` or click right mouse button then click `Quit`.    


## Procedures To Run This Game On Your Machine 
In order to run this game, you need to follow these steps - 
- Make sure your machine have `Codeblocks IDE` and `GLUT` installed.  
- Open a new `GLUT` project. 
- Replace `main.cpp` file of your new project folder by the `main.cpp` file of this repository. 
- Now `build` and `run` the code. 
- Enjoy the game.
